## 🚀 What is PortfoliMe?

PortfoliMe solves the problem of "Portfolio Procrastination." Instead of spending weeks building a personal site from scratch, users can register, input their data, and instantly generate a live website with unique routing (e.g., `portfoli.me/username`).

It is not just a static site generator; it is a **community platform** where users can discover other creatives, track profile views, and manage their professional presence dynamically.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎨 Multi-Theme Engine
Switch between completely different visual identities with a single click. The content adapts automatically to the selected aesthetic:
* **Liquid Glass:** A modern, frosted glassmorphism UI.
* **Cyberpunk:** High-contrast neon aesthetics for the bold.
* **Minimalist:** Clean typography and whitespace for professionals.
* **Paper Sketch:** A hand-drawn, creative look.
* **Skeuomorphism:** A tactile, realistic interface design.

### 🛠 No-Code Content Management
* **Skill Proficiency:** Categorize tech stacks (Frontend, Backend, etc.) and set proficiency levels with auto-generated visual bars.
* **Experience Timeline:** A visual journey of work history, internships, and education.
* **Project Showcase:** Detailed case studies, image uploads, and links to GitHub repositories or live demos.

### 🤝 Social & Collaboration
* **Collaborator Credits:** Tag other users as collaborators on your projects. The project will automatically appear on their profile's project section as well.
* **Appreciation System:** "Like" projects to show support and appreciation for fellow creators.
* **Advanced Commenting:** A beautiful, modal-based commenting system featuring:
    * **Threaded Replies:** Supports up to 3 levels of nested conversations.
    * **Smart Layout:** Includes "Show More" functionality for long threads to maintain design integrity.
    * **Full Control:** Users can edit or delete their own comments and replies.

### 🌍 Community & Discovery
* **Public Directory:** A built-in search engine to discover other designers and developers by name or role.
* **Profile Analytics:** Tracks unique views on user profiles so you know when your portfolio is getting traffic.
* **Live Presence:** Real-time online/offline status indicators.

### 🔐 Security & Ownership
* **User-Managed Access:** Users generate and manage their own GitHub Personal Access Tokens, ensuring full control over permissions.
* **Secure Storage:** GitHub tokens are hashed and securely handled to prevent unauthorized access.
* **Robust Authentication:** Powered by Firebase Authentication and enforced via strict Firestore Security Rules.
